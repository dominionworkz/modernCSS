                    <h3> War On Criminals</h3>
                    <p>Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.

                    <p>Bruce Wayne&#39;s double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, Hosting exceptional martial artist, combat strategy, inexhaustible wealth, brilliant deductive skill, advanced technology, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family&#39;s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.

                    <h3>Batman's Enemies</h3>
                    <p>Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish super-villains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime, and are often psychiatric patients at Arkham Asylum.Batman's "most implacable foe" is the Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker represents "everything Batman [opposes]". Other long-time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery include Catwoman (a cat burglar anti-heroine who is variously an ally and romantic interest), the Penguin, Ra's al Ghul, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer Croc, among others.
